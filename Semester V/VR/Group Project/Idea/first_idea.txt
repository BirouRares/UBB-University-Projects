For fear of heights, the therapy involves gradually exposing the patient to height-related situations, starting from mild to more challenging scenarios, to desensitize their fear response.
Core Principles of Exposure Therapy
Gradual Exposure: Start with low-stress situations and progress to higher-stress scenarios.
Repetition: Repeated exposure helps normalize the feared situation and reduce the emotional response.
Safety and Control: Ensure the patient feels safe, with the ability to pause or stop if overwhelmed.


General idea:
The project revolves around a player progressively jumping into a swimming pool from higher platforms. The player reaches these platforms via an elevator, symbolizing gradual exposure to increasing heights. The serene and fun setting of a pool makes the exposure less intimidating and more engaging.
Objective: Help the player (representing someone with acrophobia) desensitize to heights by combining gamification (fun mechanics) with psychological techniques like gradual exposure.


The stages of exposure:
Design Objectives:
Create a calming and safe environment to reduce initial fear. Gradually increase the height levels for systematic exposure.
Incorporate positive feedback and reinforcement after each jump.
Features to Include:
An elevator system that moves players to the next level.
A clear progression of heights (marked levels like "Level 1: Low Dive" to "Level 4: Sky Dive").
Calming visuals , such as soothing water effects .
