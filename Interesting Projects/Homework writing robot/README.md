Homemade robot which is meant for writing and drawing on a piece of paper. It is powered by 2 stepper motors(one for each X/Y axis), and one smaller electrical engine meant for lifting the pen up. 
All the components are wired up to an  Arduino Uno with a CNC Shield V3. The software part is covered by BenBox app with the right adjustments.
