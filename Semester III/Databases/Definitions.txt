A relation is in the first normal form (1NF) if and only if it doesn't
have any repeating attributes.

• if a relation contains a functional dependency, associations among values can
be stored multiple times (data redundancy)


A relation is in the second normal form (2NF) if and only if:
1. it is in the first normal form and
2. every (simple or composite) non-prime attribute is fully functionally
dependent on every key of the relation.


A relation is in the third normal form (3NF) if and only if it is in the
second normal form and no non-prime attribute is transitively dependent on
any key in the relation
Another definition: A relation 𝑅 is in the third normal form (3NF) iff, for every
non-trivial functional dependency 𝑋 → 𝐴 that holds over 𝑅:
• 𝑋 is a superkey, or
• 𝐴 is a prime attribute.


. A relation is in the Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) if and only if
every determinant (for a functional dependency) is a key (informal definition -
simplifying assumption: determinants are not too big; only non-trivial
functional dependencies are considered).



Definition. A relation 𝑅𝑅 is in 4NF iff, for every multi-valued dependency
𝛼𝛼 ⇉ 𝛽𝛽 that holds over 𝑅𝑅, one of the statements below is true:
• 𝛽𝛽 ⊆ 𝛼𝛼 or 𝛼𝛼 ∪ 𝛽𝛽 = 𝑅𝑅, or
• 𝛼𝛼 is a superkey.
• trivial multi-valued dependency 𝛼𝛼 ⇉ 𝛽𝛽 in relation 𝑅𝑅: 𝛽𝛽 ⊆ 𝛼𝛼 or 𝛼𝛼 ∪ 𝛽𝛽 = 𝑅𝑅
• if 𝑅𝑅[𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽, 𝛾𝛾] and 𝛼𝛼 ⇉ 𝛽𝛽 (non-trivial, 𝛼𝛼 not a superkey), 𝑅𝑅 is decomposed into
the following relations:
𝑅𝑅1[𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽] = 𝛱𝛱𝛼𝛼⋃𝛽𝛽 𝑅𝑅
𝑅𝑅2[𝛼𝛼,𝛾𝛾] = 𝛱𝛱𝛼𝛼⋃𝛾𝛾 𝑅𝑅
• relation DFM' is decomposed into:
DF [Department, FacultyMember]
DM [Department, MeetingDate]


Relation 𝑅𝑅 is in 5NF iff every non-trivial JD is implied by the
candidate keys in R

• JD ∗ {𝛼𝛼1, 𝛼𝛼2, ..., 𝛼𝛼m} on 𝑅𝑅 is trivial iff at least one 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is the set of all
attributes of 𝑅𝑅.
• JD ∗ {𝛼𝛼1, 𝛼𝛼2, ..., 𝛼𝛼m} on 𝑅𝑅 is implied by the candidate keys of 𝑅𝑅 iff each 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is
a superkey in R
